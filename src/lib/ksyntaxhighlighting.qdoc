    \brief KSyntaxHighlighting is a stand-alone implementation of the Kate syntax highlighting engine.

    It's meant as a building block for text editors as well as for simple highlighted text rendering (e.g. as HTML), supporting both integration with a custom editor as well as a ready-to-use QSyntaxHighlighter sub-class.
